        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          Place basmati rice in a large bowl; cover with warm water and set
          aside. Wash whole heads garlic; set aside.
        </p>
      </li>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
            Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or large skillet over high heat until smoking. Add lamb; cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in onions; cook and stir until softened and browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in carrots; cook and stir until softened, about 10 minutes. Add barberries, cumin, coriander, and peppercorns; drop whole heads garlic into Dutch oven, stirring to evenly distribute. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook 30 minutes. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
            Wash and drain basmati rice with hot water; add to Dutch oven in an even layer on top of lamb. Slowly pour in 2 cups boiling water. The rice should be covered with about 3/4-inch water. Do not stir. Season with salt; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until rice is tender and liquid absorbed, about 20 minutes. Stir rice and lamb together; serve with whole garlic heads on top.
